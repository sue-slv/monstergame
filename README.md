Created during the Coding Fundamentals Course / Digital Women Program / Redi-School Berlin / 2021    
Based on real life events of a migrant in Germany trying a career change  
Using Python and some randomness :)  

*Instructions* 
1. Your goal is to beat the monster that keeps you from learning to code  
2. When the game starts, you and the monster have 100 points each  
3. You attack the monster, and the monster loses points
4. The monster always counterattacks
5. The attacks -and the strength- are a bit "random", as some life events  
6. You can try the healing option to recover some points  
7. The game ends when the player or the monster reach 0 points  
8. The best players are registered in the winners table
